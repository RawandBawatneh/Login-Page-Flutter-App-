# Flutter Login Page App 🐻

This is a simple Flutter application that demonstrates a login page. The app includes text fields for entering an email and password, a login button, and a message that indicates whether the login was successful or not. The credentials are hardcoded for testing purposes.

## Features ✨
- **Email and Password Fields** 📧🔑: Input fields for entering an email address and password.
- **Validation** ✅: When the user presses the login button, the app checks if the entered credentials match the hardcoded values:
  - Email: `tariq@gmail.com`
  - Password: `112233`
- **Message Display** 💬: After the login attempt, a message is displayed indicating whether the login was successful ("Welcome") or failed ("Error").
